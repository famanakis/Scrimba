            <h2>You need a license?</h2>
            <p>You need a license for that? Not necessarily, but it is a good idea to have one for legal reasons. Having a license defines what users are allowed to "use" from your open-source ideas.</p>
            <p>So what about places that are open-source communities like Github? Since Github is open-source, does that mean you do not need a license for your projects? Well, yes and no.</p>
            <p>Generally, you do not need a license for your GitHub repository, as you automatically own the copyright to the code you create. However, adding a license to your repository can provide important legal protection and help clarify how others can use your code.</p>
            <p>By default, without a license, others may not know how they are allowed to use or distribute your code, and it may limit the adoption and growth of your project. Adding a license clarifies the terms under which others can use and distribute your code, and can protect you from legal liability if someone misuses your code.</p>  
            <p>There are many different types of licenses to choose from, such as permissive licenses like MIT or Apache, or more restrictive licenses like the GNU General Public License (GPL). Each license has its own terms and conditions, so it's important to choose the one that best suits your needs.</p>  
            <p>If you're not sure which license to choose or how to add a license to your repository, GitHub has a helpful guide that can walk you through the process. Additionally, it's always a good idea to consult with a lawyer if you have any legal questions or concerns.</p>
            <p>For my Scrimba projects I have chosen to use the basic MIT license which can be generated from Github.</p>
