# invoiceCreator

This is an Invoice Creator which can add or remove services from the invoice.   A running total is updated near the bottom of the invoice.   When services are added to the invoice(DOM), they are also added to a services array.   When services are removed from the invoice(DOM), they are also removed from the services array.   A service may only be added once per completed invoice.   To clear the invoice - either remove each line item individually or click on the Send button to refresh the page.
