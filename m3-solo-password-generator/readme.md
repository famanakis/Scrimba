# Password Generator - Solo Project

 ## A Scrimba FrontEnd Developer Path Solo Project completed using HTML, CSS, Flexbox and JavaScript.
 
# Project Purpose
 This is a password generator which generates random passwords.  Users can choose the length of the password.
 Users can also choose to have 'symbols' or 'numbers' in their passwords - or not.
 
# Project Scope 
 The Password Generator solo project meets the following requirements:
 <ul>
 <li>Build it from 'scratch'</li>
 <li>Generate two random passwords when the user clicks the button</li>
 <li>Each password should be 15 characters long</li>
 </ul>
 
 My project includes the following 'stretch goals':
 <ul>
<li>Ability to set password length</li>
<li>Add 'copy-on-click'</li>
<li>Toggle 'symbols' and 'numbers' on/off</li>
<li>Added a toggle for light/dark mode</li>
 </ul>
