# Unit Converter - Solo Project

 ## A Scrimba FrontEnd Developer Path Solo Project completed using HTML, CSS, Flexbox and Responsive Design.

 # Project Purpose
 A basic unit convertor that converts a number to various units of measurement to include length, volume, and mass.
 
 # Project Scope
 The 'Unit Converter' solo project meets the following requirements:
 <ul>
 <li>Follow the design spec</li>
 <li>Generate all conversions when the user clicks "Convert"</li>
 <li>Round the numbers down to three decimal places</li>
 </ul>
 
 My project includes the following 'stretch goals':
 <ul>
<li>Choose your own color palette</li>
<li>Clicking on input resets value to blank</li>
<li>Number input grows with text</li>
<li>Set a max-length for the input</li>
 </ul>
