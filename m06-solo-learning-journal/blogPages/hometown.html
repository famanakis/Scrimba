            <h2>Hometown Homepage</h2>
            <p>One of my first projects made with HTML and CSS. I learned a lot about responsive design and what a lifesaver Flexbox can be.</p>
            <p>So, what is Flexbox?</p>
            <p>Flexbox is a layout mode in CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) that provides a more efficient and flexible way to organize, align and distribute space among items in a container, even when their size is unknown or dynamic. It allows designers to create complex and responsive layouts with ease.</p>
            <p>With flexbox, you can specify how the items within a container should be arranged along the main axis (horizontal) and cross axis (vertical). You can also control the size and order of each item, as well as the spacing between them.</p>
            <p>Some of the key features of flexbox include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="ul-li">Flex container: The container becomes a flex container by setting the display property to flex or inline-flex.</li>
                <li class="ul-li">Flex items: The child elements of the flex container become flex items.</li>
                <li class="ul-li">Main axis: The main axis is the primary axis along which flex items are arranged.</li>
                <li class="ul-li">Cross axis: The cross axis is perpendicular to the main axis and is used for alignment and distribution of flex items.</li>
                <li class="ul-li">Flex direction: This property controls the direction of the main axis (row or column).</li>
                <li class="ul-li">Flex wrap: This property controls whether flex items should wrap to a new line when there isn't enough space in the container.</li>
                <li class="ul-li">Justify content: This property controls the alignment of flex items along the main axis.</li>
                <li class="ul-li">Align items: This property controls the alignment of flex items along the cross axis.</li>
                <li class="ul-li">Align content: This property controls the alignment of multiple lines of flex items along the cross axis.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Flexbox is widely used in web development to create responsive and dynamic layouts that work well on different screen sizes and devices.</p>
            <p>In my Hometown Homepage Solo project I used flex box to make the page more responsive as the use might be on larger or smaller/mobile devices. This included changing the flex-direction of the 'Top Thing to Do' div from columns to rows depending on what size screen was being used by the browser.</p>
